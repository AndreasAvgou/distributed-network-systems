# Distributed Network Systems

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various **distributed network algorithms**, including **flooding**, **echo**, and **real-time flooding**. These algorithms demonstrate fundamental concepts in distributed computing, such as message passing, network communication, and fault tolerance.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Flooding Algorithm

- Implements a simple flooding mechanism where a message is broadcast to all neighbors.
- Ensures that each node forwards the message exactly once.
- Useful for network discovery and message propagation.

ðŸ“‚ **Location**: `flooding-algorithm/`

### 2. Echo Algorithm

- A wave algorithm where a root node initiates a message, which propagates and returns through a spanning tree.
- Used for leader election and distributed synchronization.

ðŸ“‚ **Location**: `echo-algorithm/`

### 3. Real-Time Flooding Algorithm

- Enhances the flooding algorithm with real-time message input.
- Avoids message loops using unique message IDs.
- Can be used for real-time network-wide notifications.

ðŸ“‚ **Location**: `real-time-flooding/`

## Installation & Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `socket` (built-in module)
- `threading` (built-in module)

### Running an Algorithm

Each algorithm has its own directory with a corresponding `README.md` for detailed instructions.

Example (Running Flooding Algorithm):

```bash
cd flooding-algorithm
python flooding.py
```
